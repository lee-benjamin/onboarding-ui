#### How to Run

##### Running with Gulp
You will need npm. You can get it at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Once you have it, run `npm install` to install the dependencies this project relies on.

If you are running the app for the first time, run `gulp dev` to generate the runtime sources. This task will also start a server with live-reload.

Henceforth, you can run `gulp` to start the server without unnecessarily regenerating the runtime files. This server will also have live-reload.

You will see the app being served at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).
