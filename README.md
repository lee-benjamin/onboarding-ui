#### How to Run

##### Running with Gulp
You will need npm. You can get it at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/). 

Once you have it, run `npm install` to install the dependencies this project relies on.

Run `gulp` to start the server. This command serves the files as well as generates the runtime sources among other tasks. This server will also have live-reload.

You will see the app being served at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).
