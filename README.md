#### How to Run

##### Running with Gulp
You will need `gulp` and `gulp-connect`. I downloaded both modules via `npm`.

Once you have both, run `gulp` in the root directory of this git repo, and voila!

You will see the app being served at (localhost:9000)[http://localhost:9000/].

##### Running With Node
Clone this repository in the directory of your choosing.

Ensure you have node installed on your machine. You can verify this by running `node -v`.

Once you are confident node is installed, `cd` into the repo and run this command:

`node src/main.js`

#### Node Version
I am running node version `v8.9.4`.
